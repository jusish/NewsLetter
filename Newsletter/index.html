            <p>
              Nigeria, an African country on the Gulf of Guinea, has many
              natural landmarks and wildlife reserves. Protected areas such as
              Cross River National Park and Yankari National Park have
              waterfalls, dense rainforest, savanna and rare primate habitats.
              One of the most recognizable sites is Zuma Rock, a 725m-tall
              monolith outside the capital of Abuja that is pictured on the
              national currency.
